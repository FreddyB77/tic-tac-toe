#Tic-Tac-Toe by Angela Perez

Play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You can either play with 2 players or with an AI.
This game was created as my first project for the General Assembly Web Development Immersive. 

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery to create this game. I had just been taught jQuery and was testing out my abilities. In the future, I would like to add a timer button and a high score chart that displays after a game is won. 

## Notes about Two Player version
-basic functionality works

## Notes about the AI version
-the AI for this version still needs some work. The goal is for the AI to try and block the player when there are two X's in a row. This is still a work in progress.

## Included in both versions of the game
